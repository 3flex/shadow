The Shadow plugin provides the ability to merge your application code with your upstream dependencies into a single
distributable JAR file. In addition, it allows for transforming non-Java Class files during the merge process and
relocating Java Class files to new packages to avoid class conflicts.

The Shadow plugin is built on top of Gradle's Jar task and uses JarInputStreams to efficiently and quickly read
the data from dependencies.
