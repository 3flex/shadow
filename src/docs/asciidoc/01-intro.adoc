== Introduction

Shadow is a Gradle plugin for combining dependency classes and resources with a project's into a single
output Jar.
The combined Jar is often referred to a __fat-jar__ or __uber-jar__.
Shadow utilizes `JarInputStream` and `JarOutputStream` to efficiently process dependent libraries
into the output jar without incurring the I/O overhead of expanding the jars to disk.
