== Configuring Shadow

The `ShadowJar` task type extends from Gradle's `Jar` type.
This means that all attributes and methods available on `Jar` are also available on `ShadowJar`.
Refer the __Gradle User Guide__ for https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html[Jar] for
details.
